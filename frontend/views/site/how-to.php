            <h2>Learn how to create a church profile</h2>
            <p>This video will show you how to create a church profile.  The church profile is representative of all organization profiles, so if you plan to create any organization profile, this is the place to start.  In preparation, it is helpful to have ready a church description and two pictures, one large (minimum 1200x315 pixels) and one small (minimum 370x280 pixels), both with a maximum file size of 4MB.   The forms are self-explanatory, but this how-to-video will let you see in advance the steps necessary to create your profile.</p>

            <h2>Learn how to create a pastor profile</h2>
            <p>The pastor profile is representative of all individual profiles.  Note that in order to create an individual profile, your home or sending church must already be in the directory.  Every individual profile must be linked to an active church profile.  In preparation, it is helpful to have ready a personal description and two pictures, one large (minimum 1200x315 pixels) and one small (minimum 370x280 pixels), both with a maximum file size of 4MB.   The forms are self-explanatory, but this how-to-video will let you see in advance the steps necessary to create your profile.</p>
